# One-pass algorithm

In computing, a one-pass algorithm is a streaming algorithm which reads its input exactly once, in order, without unbounded buffering. A one-pass algorithm generally requires O(n) (see 'big O' notation) time and less than O(n) storage (typically O(1)), where n is the size of the input.
