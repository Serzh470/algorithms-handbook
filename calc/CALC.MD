 - (Euclidean algorithm)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm] is a method for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers (numbers), the largest number that divides them both without a remainder. 
 - (Sieve of Eratosthenes)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes] is an ancient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit.
